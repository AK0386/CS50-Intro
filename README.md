## Problem Set-1
### Hello, it's me
[Link]https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/me/
#### Context
In a file called hello.c, in a folder called me, implement a program in C that prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user. For instance, if the user’s name is Adele, your program should print hello, Adele\n!

### Mario-Less

#### Context
In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-less, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks.

But prompt the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:


Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.

### Mario-More

### Cash
[Link]https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/cash/
#### Context
Suppose you work at a store and a customer gives you $1.00 (100 cents) for candy that costs $0.50 (50 cents). You’ll need to pay them their “change,” the amount leftover after paying for the cost of the candy. When making change. odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!). In a file called cash.c in a folder called cash, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents.
