## Problem Set-1
### Hello, it's me
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/me/)
#### Context
In a file called hello.c, in a folder called me, implement a program in C that prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user. For instance, if the user’s name is Adele, your program should print hello, Adele\n!

### Mario-Less

    ###
But prompt the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:


Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.

### Mario-More

#### Context
In a file called cash.c in a folder called cash, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents.

### Credit
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/credit/)
#### Context
In a file called credit.c in a folder called credit, implement a program in C that checks the validity of a given credit card number using Luhn’s Algorithm


## Problem Set-1
### Scrabble
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/2/scrabble/)
#### Context
In a file called scrabble.c in a folder called scrabble, implement a program in C that determines the winner of a short Scrabble-like game. Your program should prompt for input twice: once for “Player 1” to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. Then, depending on which player scores the most points, your program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” (in the event the two players score equal points).

### Readability
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/2/readability/)
#### Context
In a file called readability.c in a folder called readability, you’ll implement a program that calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. 

### Caesar
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/2/caesar/)
#### Context
In a file called caesar.c in a folder called caesar, write a program that enables you to encrypt messages using Caesar’s cipher.

### Substitution
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/2/substitution/)
#### Context
In a file called substitution.c in a folder called substitution, create a program that enables you to encrypt messages using a substitution cipher. 

## pset-3
### Plurality
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/plurality/)
#### Context
At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.
Extended the functionality of “distribution code” provided to me by CS50’s staff

### Runoff
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/runoff/)
#### Context
In an instant runoff election, voters can rank as many candidates as they wish. If any candidate has a majority (more than 50%) of the first preference votes, that candidate is declared the winner of the election.
